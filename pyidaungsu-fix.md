Fixing the issue directly in the Pyidaungsu.ttf font involves modifying the font’s OpenType features, particularly its GSUB (Glyph Substitution) and GPOS (Glyph Positioning) tables, which handle text shaping and rendering rules for the Myanmar script.

This process requires using specialized font-editing software to update the font’s internal logic to enforce the traditional rules you described (e.g., ensuring that male characters always appear above female characters). Below is a detailed guide to achieve this:

Tools Required
	1.	FontForge (Free and Open-Source):
	•	A powerful font editor.
	•	Download FontForge
	2.	Microsoft VOLT (Windows-only):
	•	Used to edit OpenType layout features (GSUB and GPOS).
	•	Download VOLT
	3.	Glyphs App (macOS, Paid):
	•	A professional font editor.
	•	Download Glyphs App
	4.	TTX/FontTools (Python Library):
	•	Allows programmatic editing of font files.
	•	Install via pip install fonttools.

Steps to Fix the Pyidaungsu Font

1. Understand the Issue
	•	The OpenType layout tables in the font determine how glyphs are substituted and positioned.
	•	GSUB (Glyph Substitution Table): Responsible for contextual substitutions (e.g., stacking diacritics or reordering glyphs).
	•	GPOS (Glyph Positioning Table): Handles adjustments to the position of glyphs (e.g., stacking marks above base glyphs).

2. Analyze the Existing Font Rules
	•	Open the Pyidaungsu.ttf font in FontForge or TTX/FontTools.
	•	Examine the existing GSUB and GPOS rules for Myanmar characters.
	•	Look for contextual substitution rules that reorder glyphs.
	•	Identify the placement of marks and stacking behavior.

3. Add or Modify OpenType Rules
	•	Add rules to prioritize male characters over female characters in sequences.

Example: GSUB Rule for Reordering

lookup reorder_male_female {
    sub @male_glyphs @female_glyphs' by @male_glyphs @female_glyphs;
} reorder_male_female;

	•	Define glyph classes for male and female characters:
	•	Male Characters: က, ခ, ဂ, etc.
	•	Female Characters: ယ, ရ, etc.

4. Recompile the Font
	•	Save your changes and recompile the font.

In FontForge:
	1.	Open the font.
	2.	Go to Element > Font Info > Lookups.
	3.	Edit or add substitution and positioning rules.
	4.	Generate the font file (File > Generate Fonts).

5. Test the Modified Font
	•	Install the modified font on your system.
	•	Use tools like Word, Notepad, or custom applications to test the rendering of Myanmar text.

Example Test Words:
	•	Correct: သက္က
	•	Incorrect (to be fixed): စစ္ကိုင်း

6. Automate Fixes with TTX/FontTools

You can also modify the font programmatically using Python and fontTools.

Example: Edit GSUB Table with fontTools

from fontTools.ttLib import TTFont

# Load the font
font = TTFont("Pyidaungsu.ttf")

# Access the GSUB table
gsub = font["GSUB"]

# Add or modify substitution rules
# Example: Reordering male and female glyphs
# NOTE: Requires detailed knowledge of the table structure

# Save the modified font
font.save("Pyidaungsu_fixed.ttf")

Challenges
	•	Modifying fonts directly requires in-depth knowledge of font engineering and OpenType specifications.
	•	Incorrect changes to the GSUB/GPOS tables may break the font’s functionality.
	•	Testing the modified font across platforms and applications is crucial to ensure compatibility.

Alternative Approach

If modifying the font directly feels overwhelming, consider:
	•	Working with a professional font designer to update the Pyidaungsu font.
	•	Contacting the Pyidaungsu font’s maintainers to report the issue and request a fix.

Next Steps
	1.	Download and set up FontForge or VOLT.
	2.	Explore the GSUB and GPOS tables in Pyidaungsu.ttf.
	3.	Add reordering and contextual rules for male and female characters.
	4.	Test the font extensively with different text samples.
